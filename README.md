# Monika Meyers Movie search code challenge

## The idea
 I've never tried any of the tools you suggested or needed me to use so I tried to get up to speed on them as best I could in the time I had. I was able to build a call for the api. It is in the webservices/public/search.js and the index.js Was going to create the response requested using the search results but ran out of time. 
## The User Interface/ Webpage
 The use of Vue was not working for me so the user interface didn't get built but the plan was to have a page that has a text bar in the center similar in lay to a google search page. Then once the search phrase was entered the results would populate below in a grid with the poster at the top of each result and the other information below.

Thank you for the opportunity.
